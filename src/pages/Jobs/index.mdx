# Careers at Carapace

Carapace is building decentralized protection against default risk in unsecured crypto loans(aka. credit default swaps). Our aim is to be the biggest credit risk protection protocol in DeFi, starting with default risk.

We’re a globally distributed team of builders with a mission to build healthy financial services for all. We were founded within the [South Park Commons program](https://www.southparkcommons.com/), and backed by world-class VCs and angels. We will announce the details shortly.

We are hiring for founding team members. This is an opportunity to work at the cutting edge of crypto and financial markets. Come join us as one of the earliest members of this team where you’ll help shape the vision, strategy and culture of this protocol.
