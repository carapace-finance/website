<h2>Abstract</h2>

This paper proposes decentralized protection against default risk in under-collateralized crypto loans. Traditionally, protection against credit default risk is known as credit default swaps.

We aim to build the next DeFi primitive currently missing in the market to make DeFi more resilient to credit risks. Credit risk protection is critical for the mass adoption of decentralized finance.

We create a market where traders can swap the default risk. Protection buyers pay a premium to get the right to claim protection when an underlying loan defaults. Protection sellers provide capital for protection in exchange for a premium. When a default event occurs, a payout is made to protection buyers.

Carapace protocol is a non-custodial automated market maker implemented on a blockchain. Our automated market maker (AMM) pools liquidity and makes it available to swap traders according to an algorithm such as our premium pricing formula that fluctuates with supply and demand and the exchange rate formula that keeps increasing with the interest accrual.
